            of these options, some data will be collected.

            <strong>Retention:</strong> We will store and process your data

            <strong>Usage:</strong> Server functions use IP addresses to execute event handling functions 
            and HTTP functions based on end-user actions. These functions assist the user with 
            computationally intensive tasks or operations that require a higher level of security 
            verification before the data can be sent to the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Retention:</strong> Server functions temporarily store IP addresses 
            only to provide the service and ensure security against DDoS attacks.

            <strong>Usage:</strong> Hosting uses the IP addresses of incoming requests 
            to detect abuse and provide us with a detailed analysis of usage data. 
            We use hosting to operate all our websites, including the website you are currently visiting.

            <strong>Retention:</strong> Hosting stores IP data for several months.
